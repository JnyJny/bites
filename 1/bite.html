<p>Write a Python function that calculates the sum of a list of numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function should accept a list of numbers and return the sum of those numbers.</li>
<li>If no argument is provided (that is, <code>numbers</code> is <code>None</code>), return the sum of the numbers 1 to 100 (<strong>Note</strong> that this&nbsp;is not the same as an empty list of numbers being passed in. In that case the sum returned will be 0).</li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun!</p>
